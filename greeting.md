You can use this sidebar to filter and sort the data based on the columns available in the `pfs.csv` table. Here are some examples of the kinds of questions you can ask me:

1. Filtering: "Show only White Male patients."
2. Sorting: "Show all data sorted by PFS in descending order."
3. Answer questions about the data: "How does PFS compare between males and females?"

You can also say "Reset" to clear the current filter/sort, or "Help" for more usage tips.
